I regularly give public and scientific talks. Here are a few of my favourites and others which I've made (about science) for fun.

## Astronomy on Tap, Santa Barbara
*Jack Photon: a story of light*
I wrote this story for a Science Storytelling event in Cardiff in April 2016. [This recording was made when I performed the story of Jack Photon](https://youtu.be/UF7ioBvU3_0?t=1h2m18s) again in July 2016 in California.

## TEDxCardiff
*Intelligent Robots and the Story of Light*

A conference talk in the Lorentz Centre workshop about how we use Python at LCOGT, Python in Astronomy, in April 2015.

## Ignite Cardiff

Ignite Cardiff is a series of Pecha Kucha style (5 mins, 20 slides with the slides autoadvancing every 15s) talks on a variety of different subjects to an audience in a Cardiff pub. I gave this talk, entitled "Telescopes in Strange Places".

## Bright Club

This is a stand-up comedy set about being a science geek, I did back in Nov 2011. Be warned, there is a little bit of naughty language at the start.
